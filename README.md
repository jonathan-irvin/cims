# CIMS
Computer Inventory Management System

# Background
What started out as a MS Access Database for school, I wanted to make something a little more robust using the available web technologies.

I wanted to base this project off of CodeIgniter, since that's what I know and love.

# Plans
* DB Structure
* Display Data
* Forms
* Reports
* Ticket System

# Forks
If this is interesting, I'm all about anyone willing to fork and submit changes.  I'm doing this to challenge myself and I don't know if I will finish, but hopefully I make it far enough in the project to make something useful.
